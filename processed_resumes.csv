a) Project Description 

GE Energy’s current CRM platform has reached end of life.  It does not satisfy the needs of the various P&L’s within Energy and the ability to remain nimble and incorporate the various needs of the business is no longer achievable.  The business has decided to move to Salesforce.com and we need to integrate to and from systems that provide necessary data to be used with CRM.
This includes the development of SFDC Source integrationwhich replaces CMS and publishes data to 15 targets. As a part of source integration, a webMethods provides the WSDL file to receive SFDC XML file .Received XML is converted into webMethods internal document type and mapped to canonical, and published to broker.Published canonical is subscribed by 4 existing targets at present.
In future, we extend the SFDC integration to publish data to few more existing subscribers.
b) Contribution
Create the project plan, gathering the requirements.
Develop the interfaces using flow service, create utility services, webservice Descriptors  .
Create Unit test plan and Integration test plan documents with sample inputs provided from client
Provide support during the test phase.
Provide Post Production support after the completion of the project for 3 weeks


a) Project Description
GE Energy Infrastructure has created an umbrella project, the vision for which includes each GEI P&L to have EDI210 outbound integration with OTM.
This includes the development of two integrations (source and target integrations).As a part of source integration, a webMethods provides the WSDL file to receive Glog XML file from OTM.Received Glog XML is converted into webMethods internal document type and mapped to canonical, and published to broker.WebMethods target integration subscribes the published canonical from webMethods broker and generates EDI210 files as per standard EDI210 schema. The generated EDI210 files are sent to Trax system through trading networks via AS2 protocol.
Trax system will send the 997 ack back to webMethods with the status of EDI210 files. WebMethods validate the received 997 files and send the 997’s with rejected status, to OTM.OTM cross checks the rejected EDI210 files and resends the valid data.

b) Contribution
Gather requirements, analyze the existing canonicals.
Develop the interfaces using flow service, create utility services, webService Descriptors..
Create Unit test plan and Integration test plan documents with sample inputs provided from client.
Prepare all project related documents.
Provide testing support in different environments.

Title: Senior Analytical Hadoop / Spark Developer

ECOMP is critical in achieving AT&T’s D2 imperatives to increase the value of our network to customers by rapidly on-boarding new services (created by AT&T or 3rd parties), enabling the creation of a new ecosystem of cloud consumer and enterprise services, reducing Capital and Operational Expenditures, and providing Operations efficiencies. It delivers enhanced customer experience by allowing them in near real time to reconfigure their network, services, and capacity. While ECOMP does not directly support legacy physical elements, it works with traditional OSS’s to provide a seamless customer experience across both virtual and physical elements. ECOMP enables network agility, elasticity, and improves Time-to-Market/Revenue/Scale via the AT&T Service Design and Creation (ASDC) visual modeling and design. The service design and creation capabilities and policy recipes eliminate many of the manual and long running processes performed via traditional OSS’s (e.g., break-fix largely moves to plan and build function). The ECOMP platform provides external applications (OSS/BSS, customer apps, and 3rd party integration) with a secured, RESTful API access control to ECOMP services.

Locomotive Distribution and Assignment system has been primarily supported for strategic planning, Tactical planning, Assign Power and Fuel Plan.
Strategic planning: The model decides how many locomotives to use of each type, and also chooses the starting location, so that the system does not require a locomotive file with starting locations.
Tactical planning: This version of the system requires a locomotive snapshot with starting locations. In a production setting, the tactical planning system is set up to run continuously during the day, updating each minute as changes are made in the train schedule or status of locomotives. The tactical system can help plan repositioning of power, as well as anticipate problems before they happen. The core engine is the same as that used for the strategic planning system.

This project aims to purge or archive the loan applications that are not get submitted. As we are aware information or data is increasing at an amazing rate. In fact some industry expects that collected information sizes will probably double in size every two to three years. Basically data which is no longer needed by the application to address business functionality should be purged or archived. If data is required for record retention requirements, then it should be archived from the DBMS to an application controlled format. Keeping unneeded data online or in warehouses have costs associated with them which can directly affect our membership. Transactions can take longer to process, and use more CPU which also increases the cost of each transaction. DBMS utilities like backups can run longer, takes more storage and use more CPU (Increase product cost)
